Hi, I’m Shaunak Datar — an electronics engineering student at VJTI, Mumbai, obsessed with systems that live close to the metal.

Most of my time goes into building custom development boards, writing bare-metal drivers, and working on my own operating system for the Raspberry Pi. I enjoy reverse engineering datasheets, bringing up hardware from scratch, and poking at memory-mapped registers until something cool happens.

Currently, I’m contributing to [RTEMS as a Google Summer of Code 2025 student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/CUL4f3Nh), adding support for peripherals like PWM, I2C, and DMA on the Raspberry Pi 4. I also like exploring compilers, messing with LLVM, and learning Rust when I’m not knee-deep in embedded code.

This blog is a space for me to document things I’m building, breaking, and learning along the way — from device drivers and toolchains to weird bugs and the occasional side project.

If low-level systems make your eyes light up, you’ll probably feel right at home here.
