👋🏽 Hey there — I’m Shaunak, an electronics engineer in the making at VJTI Mumbai.

This blog is a logbook of sorts — a place where I share what I’m building, breaking, and learning. From writing my own operating system for the Raspberry Pi to tinkering with dev boards and embedded peripherals, this space documents it all: drivers, weird bugs, logic analyzer captures, and side quests in Rust or LLVM.

Most posts here are minimal, focused, and straight from the hardware trenches.

If you like bootloaders, bare-metal systems programming, or just want to see what it takes to get an LED blinking *without* an OS — you’re in the right place.
